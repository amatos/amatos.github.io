If there is one difference between my right foot surgery compared to my left foot surgery, it's been the pain.  Or rather, the great deal _less_ pain.

My left foot hurt a lot, and I was taking pain medication fairly regularly for at least the first month.  I think I was at taking 1 Percocet every 6 hours that entire month, especially after I started working again.  The hours of remaining sitting with my leg propped up did not exactly feel great.

With my right leg, The first three days were rough.  My surgeon told me to increase my dosage of Percocet, and that was enough to get my through the rest of that week (my surgery was on a Wednesday).  By that weekend, I was down to taking 1 or 2 pills at night only, and I only was taking that because I would otherwise keep moving around so much to shift pressure and pain that I just wasn't sleeping through the night.

It's now been 2.5 weeks, and I'm only occasionally taking pain meds.  Two most nights before bed, and, every once in a while, a Percocet.

Mind, I'm not saying that there isn't any pain at all, just that it's manageable.  There's discomfort, certainly, but then, there ___always has been___ discomfort in my feet.  It's just not enough for me to feel the need for relief.

(Of course, as I'm typing this, my foot feels like it's throbbing inside the cast.  It doesn't _hurt_, per se, but it's _definitely_ noticeable.)
