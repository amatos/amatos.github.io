You know that Bangles song, "[Manic Monday][1]"?  It really feels like that today.

'Anxiously', although that sounds almost too strong, awaiting news. Although, perhaps "excitedly", or "eagerly" might be better.

But, let's be honest. I *am* both eager and excited. I *am* anxious.

It's been a long time since I've been this eager. But, I can't do anything to move things along faster. Things will either work out, or not work out. I can only sit and wait for now.

Even if I _hate_ just sitting and waiting.

ps: A bit of trivia -- Manic Monday was written by Prince, originally for Apollonia 6, shelved, and then later offered to The Bangles.
