title: The USCIS Interview
---

Another really smooth and frictionless visit to Cleveland's USCIS offices.

Man, I really have to say this: Cleveland USCIS has got to be the smoothest, easiest, and downright friendliest USCIS office in the country. Those folks made the entire process incredibly painless and efficient.

I answered some questions, went over some details on my application, confirmed that I was who I presented myself to be, and then went on to the meat of the appointment: The citizenship test and interview.

The test itself was easy. I mean, for someone who went to school here in the US since the 1st grade. No surprises, no trick questions, no memorization of obscure details. Just plain and simple questions.

The interview itself also went by pretty quickly. The agent was efficient, and we ran through the process right quick. It went by so quickly, for that matter, that it actually caught me off-guard when she said that she had all she needed, and that she would recommend my application for approval.

And just like that it's over.
(Although without as much pathos, or historical significance, as [Mr Hamilton's experience](https://youtu.be/41qJIfzaqlM?si=yDMzp811XTRDiY9d&t=168).)
