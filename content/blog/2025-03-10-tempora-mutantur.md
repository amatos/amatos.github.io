16th century german Caspar Huberinus, not Ovid, as it's frequently attributed to, but I do believe that it fit Ovid's themes.

From _Fasti_, VI, lines 771-772:

  *Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis*,

  *et fugiunt freno non remorante dies*.

More colloquially:

  The times slip away, and we grow old with the silent years,

  and the days flee unchecked by a rein.

Hubernius rendered it as:

  *Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis*;

  *Tempora mutantur, nosque mutamur in illis*.

or,

  Times are slipping away, and we get older by (through, during, with, because of) the silent years"

Although a more literal reading of the 2nd line would be closer to:

  "Times are changing, and we are changed with them"

Yes, it's that time of year again.  *Tempus fugit*.
