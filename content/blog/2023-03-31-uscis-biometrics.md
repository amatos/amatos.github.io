title: Biometrics appointment
---

That went faster than I expected. Both the waiting and actual biometrics processing took an amazingly short amount of time. I think it actually took longer to drive to Cleveland, find a parking spot, and then walk to the building, than it took waiting for my name to be called and my picture and fingerprints to be recorded.

And that's including that I didn't fill out the back of the notice (***whoops***) like I was supposed to.
