title: Feet surgery, part deux
---

Since the left foot went so darned well (no, seriously, my surgeon was fantastic and recovery went really REALLY easy), it's time to do the other foot!

Yeah.

Ok, enthusiasm off for a moment--don't get me wrong, I ***am*** most definitely enthusiastic about this. Otherwise, why go through the entire painful process all over again.

I'm not looking forward to months of being completely reliant on other people for transportation. And I don't mean just having to use the scooter if I want to move from point *a* to point *b*, no, I mean more the whole "if someone doesn't drive me to where I want to go, I'm not going".

It's not at all that I expect it to be a problem. Llewellyn was a godsend with my left foot recovery, and I'm sure will be the same godsend with my right foot. It's just that I ***do not like*** being completely dependent on other people. It offends my (really rather silly, I admit) internal drive to do things for myself.

It's silly, I know.

But it *is* reality for me. I don't look forward to it. I don't like it. I don't relish being unable to drive myself for even longer than after my left foot surgery.

But it ***is*** reality.

So, like it or not, this dislike of being dependent is just something I'll have to put aside for the next few months.

Tomorrow's surgery day.
