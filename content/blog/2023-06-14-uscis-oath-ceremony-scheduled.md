And the wait is (_almost_) over.

Well, sort-of. I still have to wait until the 3rd of July. Funny that. I had been hoping I'd be able to take my oath before the 4th of July so that I could celebrate my first Independence Day as a U.S. Citizen. Looks like I got that hope. And, on my mother's birthday as well!

Exciting!
