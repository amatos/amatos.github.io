title: Patience is not a virtue
---

The phrase, "patience is a virtue" always struck me as a little wrong. while patience certainly can be a good thing at times, I prefer to believe that patience serves a use, but is no more valuable than anything else.

After all, patience is certainly of very little use if someone is about to eat something that they are allergic to, or is having a heart attack.

But that's not really what I'm thinking about.

I can't wait for this coming week.

I can't wait for this summer.

And yet... waiting is all that I can do.
