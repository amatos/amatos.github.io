title: I looked.
---

So, you know how [yesterday I said](/2022/05/the-day-before-the-bandages-come-off), "I’m not sure I’ll have the stomach to look, much less take pictures, MUCH less post them, but… I likely will."

Turns out I had the stomach.
I :
- looked.
- was ecstatic.
- cheered.
- took pictures.
- (Or Llewellyn) took a *LOT* of pictures.

I'm not sure I'm going to post them, certainly not without an NSFW tag. Not because they're gory, but just because some folks might have a problem with the sight of bandages, dried blood, antiseptic, and stitches. And rods. Sticking out of my toes. Rods. Seriously, they look like sausages on metal skewers...but... Rods!

*Takes a deep breath*

I must have gotten the mountain climbing upgrade!!!!111!!!one-hundred-eleven!!!!!

***AWESOME***
