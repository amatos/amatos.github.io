But, definitely for a good long time.

So, why mention it? My doctor mentioned that in my last two blood tests, my glucose was elevated. Elevated enough to classify as pre-diabetic.

So, either I make changes, eat better, exercise more... or I'm looking at eventually full blown type-2 diabetes.

And that would be *bad*.

So, really, it's not an "either" case. It's an "I have to make changes" case.
