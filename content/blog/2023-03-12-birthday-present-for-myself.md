title: Birthday present for myself!
---

I'm turning 46 this year.

No, ***I have turned 46 this year***.

I don't really know how I feel about that. Well, other than maybe giving in to a little midlife crisis.

So, in the great tradition of middle-aged men who do somewhat crazy things to remind themselves of their youth ~~and virility~~, I am giving myself two birthday presents this year:

- I'm going back to [school](https://www.umgc.edu) ("Uni", for my European friends)
- I'm applying for U.S. Citizenship
