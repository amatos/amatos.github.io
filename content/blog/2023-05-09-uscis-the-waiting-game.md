title: The waiting seems endless
---

I am not always the world's most patient person.

(Yes, yes, I know how silly that sounds. Please ***do*** try not to laugh.)

I received a notice that my citizenship application has been approved. Now, I just have to wait until my oath ceremony is scheduled.

waiting... argh.

I hate waiting.
