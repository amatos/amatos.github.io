The bandages come off tomorrow!

I’m not sure I’ll have the stomach to look, much less take pictures, MUCH less post them, but… I likely will.

So far, I’ve found this process incredibly fascinating.  I can’t wait to see my new foot.

Pain management has been adequate. My surgeon recommended doubling the amount of Percocet that I was taking, and that's helped incredibly. I've gone from being in "my leg is on fire!" pain for 4 out of every 6 hours to a tolerable level of pain.

My oldest made a delicious vegetable soup yesterday, which was incredibly filling and satisfying. He's an incredible young man, whom I couldn't be prouder of. I am, of course, proud of all my kids. They are each wonderful, bring fantastic qualities into the world, and are the lights of my life. I couldn't possibly be happier with all of you. (Yes, I just took my meds about half an hour ago, but this isn't the drugs speaking.)
