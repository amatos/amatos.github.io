"Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain. -- Frank Herbert, DUNE"

Yes, I start with a quote from [DUNE](http://www.dunenovels.com). It's my favorite book, and counting just the books written by Frank Herbert, my favorite series. I probably can't explain why. I don't even know if I can say which one I experienced first -- the original novel, or the [film directed by David Lynch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/).

Why do I bring it up? In two words; change and expectations.

Alas, not something that I can go into too much detail on right now, but those two words are in the forefront of my mind.
