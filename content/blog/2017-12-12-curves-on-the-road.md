Curves on the road can be dangerous, even when you know that they're there. All that it takes is one patch of unseen ice, and before you know it, you're sliding and spinning, trying to course-correct before you end up in a ditch...or worse, before you end up in on-coming traffic.

It never fails, that with the first real snowfall of the season, so many drivers seem to forget that they need to slow down, don't slam on their brakes, and remember how to recover from a slide.

But, on the other hand, don't drive at 10 mph when the roads are mostly clear!
