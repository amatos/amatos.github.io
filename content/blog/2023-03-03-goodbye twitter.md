    --Douglas Addams

With all of the changes at [Twitter](https://twitter.com) recently, I've been less and less enthused at the platform.

With a *lot* of the folks I followed on Twitter leaving, I have less and less reason to even use the platform.

With the elimination of 3rd party Twitter clients, is it even a [platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en) any more, or is it just some rich guy's*[^1] web app?

[Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/), [Twitterrific](https://twitterrific.com/beyond), you were both great and made using Twitter much more palatable for years.  [Tapbots](https://tapbots.com/) and [Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com/), thank you so very much for making excellent apps that made Twitter a joy to use.

Any future [Twitter posts](https://twitter.com/alberthmatos) will be automatic cross-posting from picture uploads.  I do not foresee any future actual use from me.  Goodbye.

[^1]: Nota bene, this __is not__ a dig.  One of the fundamental purposes of a company selling shares of themselves on an open exchange is that [anyone can buy or sell those shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk).
