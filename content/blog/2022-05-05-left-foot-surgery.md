title: Feet surgery
---

At 45, it seems surprising for people to hear that I've never had any type of surgeries or broken bones.

Other than Lasik surgery on my eyes back in 2002(?); Nope, never had any.

Well, 2022 and 2023 promise to change all of that.

This year--tomorrow--I'm having corrective surgery on my left foot, and either later this year, although quite possibly in the Spring of next year, I'll have surgery in my right foot.

I'm \[excited, nervous, giddy, ecstatic, terrified, anxious, thrilled\].

I'm full of emotions.
